There are 2 ways to install `Achievements` on the site:

1. Via Discovery option - Scans through the site for `.badge` files.
2. Via Upload option - Uploads a package that contains a list of `.badge` files.


## Installation via Discovery
Discovery allows the system to discover for `.badge` files on the site. By default, the discovery service would search for `.badge` files through the following directories recursively.

`/administrator/components`
`/media/com_easysocial/apps/users`
`/media/com_easysocial/apps/fields`

## Installation via Upload
There are times when you have a 3rd party extension that provides you with a list of `.badge` files. You can simply upload the files through the installer to install these badges.
