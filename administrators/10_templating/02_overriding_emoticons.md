By default, EasySocial comes with a default set of emoticons. You could override this by creating your own emoticons folder in your template override. It's really simple and only requires the 2 steps below:


## Default Storage
The default storage path for emoticons are located in the following folder:

`/media/com_easysocial/images/emoticons`


## Overriding Emoticons
To create a template override for emoticons, simply copy the folder above and place it in the following folder:

`/templates/protostar/html/com_easysocial/`

Replace the `protostar` template with your Joomla template that you are currently using.
