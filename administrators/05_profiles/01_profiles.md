EasySocial comes with a profile system which allows you to create multiple profiles for users on the site. This is a very useful functionality for sites that runs on multiple user types or subscription based. It also allows you to separate different user workflows for different segment of users on your site. 

Consider this scenario:

> You have both `Teachers` as well as `Students` that signs up on your site. However, you don't actually want to ask the `Students` group their field of teaching and vice versa when you want to request more information from students.
> 
> 
> This is where profiles would come in handy because it allows you to request for information dependent on the profile type the user is signed up to.
