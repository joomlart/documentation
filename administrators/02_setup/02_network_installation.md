This is the easiest setup and is recommended for beginners. Before we begin, please ensure that you have already obtained your [API Keys](/welcome/obtaining_api_key). Once you have your API key, you may proceed with the installation steps below:


Proceed to the Joomla! extensions manager.

<div class="alert alert-notice">If you encounter an error on this page, please proceed with the troubleshooting guide for system requirements</div>




If everything is well, click on the `Next Step` button and you will be presented with the screen below which will diagnose the folders on your site. All the folders listed here needs to be writable. Otherwise the system would not allow you to proceed with the installation.

Click on the next `Next Step` button to proceed to the next step. On this screen, the installer will automatically download the package files from our download server. It may take a while depending on the connectivity of your server.
