* Site Administrators.
* Webmasters.
* Moderators.
* Site Owners.
* Any users without any coding skills.

## What Doesn't This Documentation Do
This documentation is solely geared towards site administrator. These are some of the items that you shouldn't expect from this documentation:

* Magically beautify your site.
* Magically fix errors on your site.
* Magically install [EasySocial](http://stackideas.com/easysocial) on your site.
* Customize features for your site.
* It doesn't make you a programmer.
* It doesn't make you a designer.

## Found a Typo or Bug?
We are coders who deal with machines and we are not always good with documentation specs (Although we try to be). If you have found a typo or bug, it's AWESOME! Please do remember to inform us so that we can correct it and other user's would benefit from this as well. You can reach us via <support@stackideas.com> or contact us on [our forums](http://stackideas.com/forums).
