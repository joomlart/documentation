The social stream is the main strength in EasySocial. It allows users to interact with one another via their dashboard or the profile respectively. With the stream API in EasySocial, it allows your extension to generate a new stream item and manipulate how stream items are being populated on the user's profile.

In essence, the stream API would allow your extension to:

* Create new stream record.
* Delete an existing stream record.
* Retrieve a user's stream.
