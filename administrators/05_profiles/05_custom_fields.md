Custom fields are pretty similar to any form builders. Rather than it being a form builder, it's a form that you create to harvest user's information. The custom fields in EasySocial is flexible and allows you to modify the form to your desired output.

You can add custom field to your form by going to Backend>EasySocial>Profiles, click on which profile you want to add the additional field and click on `Custom Field`.
