To manage `Profiles` that are created in EasySocial, you can access it through the sidebar navigation as you can see from the screen shot below:

![Managing Profiles](/images/administrators/05_profiles/managing_profiles_1.png)

You will then see a list of profiles that have already been created on the site. By default, EasySocial automatically creates a new profile called `Registered Users` which houses all existing users that was created on the site prior to the installation of EasySocial.
